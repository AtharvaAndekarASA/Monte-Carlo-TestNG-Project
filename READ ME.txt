AutoConstants Interface
 1. In a TestNG project, the term "AutoConstant Interface" refer to an interface 
 	or a set of constants. 
 2.	In TestNG, you can create an interface to define constants that will be used 
 	across your test classes. 
 3.	It is used to manage configuration settings or parameters for 
 	automated tests. 
 4. It helps in maintaining consistency and making your code more manageable.
 5. This approach helps in centralizing the configuration and makes it easier to 
 	update values without changing multiple files.
 	
Base Class
 1. In a TestNG project, a Base Class is a common class that contains setup and 
 	teardown methods, as well as utility functions that can be shared across the
 	multiple test classes. 
 2.	This helps in reducing code duplication and maintaining consistency.
 3. By using a Base Class, you ensure that common setup and teardown logic is hence
 	centralized, making your test code cleaner and easier to maintain.
 	
WebDriver Utilities Class
 1. Creating a WebDriver utilities class in a TestNG project is a great way to manage
	common WebDriver operations.
 2.	WebDriver Utilities Class helps in keeping your test code clean and organized.
 3.	WebDriver Utilities setup ensures that your WebDriver initialization and cleanup 
 	are handled in a centralized manner, making your tests more maintainable and less
 	prone to errors
 	
Data Utilities Class
 1. A DataUtilities class in a TestNG project typically contains methods for handling 
	data-driven testing. This class can include utilities for reading data from various
	sources like Excel files, CSV files, databases, or even JSON files. 
 2. It helps in organizing and managing test data efficiently.

	Steps:
	   i) Add dependency from Apache POI
	  ii) Create a DataUtilities Class
	 iii) Declare the object in the base class
	  iv) Use it in your testcase class by extending BaseClass
 	
Listeners Class
 1. In TestNG, listeners are used to listen to the events that occur during the 
	execution of test cases. They allow you to perform certain actions based on 
	these events, such as logging, taking screenshots on failure, or modifying 
	test results.
 2. Listeners Class : A listeners class in TestNG implements one or more listener 
	interfaces provided by TestNG.The listener interfaces we used are:
	   i) ITestListener : Listens to events related to test methods.
 3.	Listeners are powerful tools in TestNG that help you manage and customize the 
 	behavior of your tests.

 

We created a testing framework of MonteCarlo e-commerce web application. The framework is made up of 
the following components:

1. **Project Structure**: 
	We have our main application code under `src/main/java` and our test classes under `src/test/java`. 
	Our `testng.xml` configuration file defines the test suites and groups.

2. **Dependencies**: 
	We use Maven to manage our dependencies, including Selenium WebDriver for browser automation, TestNG 
	for our testing framework, and ExtentReports for generating detailed test reports.

3. **Base Class**: 
	We have a base class that initializes the WebDriver, sets up browser configurations, and includes
	setup and teardown methods for each test. We also use annotations like `@BeforeMethod` and `@AfterMethod`
	to handle preconditions and cleanup.

4. **Page Object Model (POM)**: 
	To enhance maintainability, we use the Page Object Model pattern. Each web page is represented by 
	a class with methods to interact with its elements.

5. **Test Classes**: 
	Our test classes contain methods annotated with `@Test`, which include the actual test logic.

6. **Reporting**: 
	We use ExtentReports to generate visually appealing HTML reports that include detailed information 
	about the test execution, system environment, and screenshots on failure.


By using TestNG Famework on MonteCarlo web application, we can efficiently manage and execute our automated test 
cases,ensuring our website functions as expected across different browsers and scenarios. This framework helps us 
maintain high-quality standards and quickly identify any issues by taking screenshots of the failed test cases and 
reporting the logs in the log file as well as generating index html reports and emailable reports."
